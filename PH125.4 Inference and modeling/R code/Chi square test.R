# Imagine we have 290, 1,345, 177, 1,011 applicants, some are men and some are women and 
# some get funded, whereas others donâ€™t. We saw that the success rates for men and woman were:

# percent_men percent_women
#    0.17737     0.1489899

# The Chi-square test answers this question. The first step is to create the 
# two-by-two data table:

two_by_two <- data.frame(awarded=c("no","yes"),
                         men = c(totals$no_men,totals$yes_men),
                         women = c(totals$no_women,totals$yes_women))
two_by_two

# The general idea of the Chi-square test is to compare this two-by-two table 
# to what you expect to see. We build a 2x2 applying the total rate to total applications
# by gender


data.frame(awarded=c("no","yes"),
           men = (totals$no_men+totals$yes_men)*c(1-rate,rate),
           women = (totals$no_women+totals$yes_women)*c(1-rate,rate))
